<h1>Responsive Web Design Layouts</h1>

<p>In this repository there are three examples of responsive web design layouts and one example of how to use CSS to modify image shapes and wrap text around those images. The first example is a website made with a twelve column grid, the second shows how to modify image shapes, the third uses flexbox, and the last one uses the css grid.</p>

<p>1) The twelve column grid <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Web_Design/blob/master/ColumnGrid/index.html">example</a>. Note: To get the social media icons to work in the GitHub Previewer, you have to inspect the page with developer tools, and navigate to the header, ul, li, a, and in the background-image url, delete one of the periods in the relative url (should look like: url(./images/socialSprites.png). Oddly, GitHub will not update to a single period from my end to display the icons for their previewer. Play around with resizing the browser to see how the columns adjust.</p>

<p>2) This example shows how to modify image shapes using CSS/SCSS with clip-path and shape-outside. View the <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Web_Design/blob/master/CSS_Shapes/index.html">example</a>. A great resource for shaping these images can be found <a href="https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/">here</a>.</p>

<p>3) Flexbox: </p>

<p>4) Grid: </p>

<p>5) Mobile Music Player Site Example. This combines many of the responsive web design practices employed in the earlier lessons. It consists of three pages: <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Web_Design/master/MusicPlayer/index.html">Album</a>, <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Web_Design/master/MusicPlayer/player.html">Player</a>, and <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Web_Design/master/MusicPlayer/artist.html">Artist<a>. Take a look at these on phones, rotating the screens to see the responsive design of the elements.</p>
