<h1>Responsive Web Design Layouts</h1>

<p>In this repository there are three examples of responsive web design layouts. The first one a website made with a twelve column grid, the second uses flexbox, and the last one uses the css grid.</p>

<p>1) The twelve column grid <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Web_Design/blob/master/ColumnGrid/index.html">example</a>. Note: To get the social media icons to work in the GitHub Previewer, you have to inspect the page with developer tools, and navigate to the header, ul, li, a, and in the background-image url, delete one of the periods in the relative url (should look like: url(./images/socialSprites.png). Oddly, GitHub will not update to a single period from my end to display the icons for their previewer.</p>
