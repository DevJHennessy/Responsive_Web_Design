<h1>CSS Grid Layout With Text</h1>

<p>A mobile-first website example that demonstrates how to use CSS Grids for a responsive design layout. This example is made with SASS and utilizes partial views. When viewed on small screens (< 560px), the screen only spans one fraction and first row of text takes up all columns as the headline story. The remaining rows are divided into two columns of text. When viewed on medium screens (560px - 1027px), screen is divided up into three fractions. The article's first-child takes up one column and two rows while all the rest only take up one row and one column. When viewed on a large screen (> 1028px), the screen is divided into four fractions. The article's first-child takes up two columns and two rows. The article's second-child takes up two columns and one row. The rest of the article's children take up one column and one row. </p>
